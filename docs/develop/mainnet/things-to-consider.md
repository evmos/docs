# Things to Consider

Before deploying a smart contract or decentralized application (dApp) on the Evmos mainnet, it's important to take into account several critical aspects to guarantee a secure and successful deployment.

- Testing: Thoroughly test your smart contracts in a testing environment to ensure it operates as intended. Comprehensive tests should ensure all functions, error handling, and edge cases are covered.

- Security: Whenever possible, perform a comprehensive security audit of the smart contract code to identify and eliminate any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses. This is especially vital for the mainnet, as the code will be accessible to everyone and any security flaws could result in substantial losses. Learn about the common vulnerabilities and contract security practices. 

- Gas costs: Evaluate the gas costs associated with deploying and executing the smart contract, including the cost of deploying the contract and executing its functions are sufficient or efficient for end users.

- Contract upgradeability: Consider the possibility of upgrading the contract in the future and implement upgrade mechanisms if needed. This will enable you to make changes to the contract without having to redeploy it, creating a new contract.

- Dependencies: Verify that any external libraries or dependencies used by the contract are up-to-date and secure.

- Contract ownership: Ensure proper management of contract ownership and consider implementing a multi-sig mechanism for increased security.

- Contract documentation: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for the contract, including its purpose, functions, and potential risks. This will assist users in understanding how to use the contract and make it easier for other developers to review and contribute to the code.

- Network congestion: Take into account network congestion and its impact on the deployment and execution of the smart contract. During high network usage, gas prices may be higher, and transactions may take longer to confirm.
