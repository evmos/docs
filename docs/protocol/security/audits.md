# Audits

Evmos is connecting two major worlds in the crypto universe by enabling
compatibility between the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems.
This does not come without its difficulties, and security always
is a top priority for the Evmos developers.

Each feature is extensively tested and internally audited by the team
before being brought to the users.
However, external audits are a valuable and necessary assurance for the
security of the protocol itself and with that,
also for anyone deploying on or using Evmos.
