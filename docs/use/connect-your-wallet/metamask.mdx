# MetaMask

To interact with the Evmos blockchain, you can use MetaMask, a popular wallet
browser extension that launched with Ethereum. Once connected to Evmos, you can use Metamask
to manage your Evmos accounts and interact with dApps on Evmos.

## Connect to Mainnet

If you don't have MetaMask installed, go to the [MetaMask
website](https://metamask.io/download/) and install the extension for your
browser. Once installed, click the button below to connect your Metamask wallet
with Evmos Mainnet using Chainlist.

<button onClick={() => parent.open('https://chainlist.org/chain/9001')} className="bg-red mb-4 hover:bg-red1 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
    Connect to Mainnnet
</button>

Chainlist helps you connect to the Evmos Blockchain. It provides an overview of
RPC nodes that you can connect to. The purpose of RPC nodes is to allow
applications and users to communicate with a Blockchain network. RPC nodes
listen for requests, respond with the necessary data, or execute the requested
transaction.

Click `Add to Metamask` to connect to the standard provider or choose
from a list of RPC Server providers by clicking `Connect Wallet` next to the
address.

Once you've connected to an RPC Server, you're ready to go and can start using
Evmos. If you run into any issues, you can switch your RPC endpoint, and you
should be good to go.

## Connect to Testnet

You might want to connect your wallet to the Evmos Testnet to interact with
dApps that havn't launched on Mainnet yet. Click the button below to connect
your Metamask wallet with Evmos Testnet using Chainlist:

    Connect to Testnet
</button>

## Connect to Local Node

You can also connect Metamask to a local node, which is useful if you are
planning on developing on Evmos locally. If you haven't already set up your own
local node, refer to [the quickstart
tutorial](./../../protocol/evmos-cli/single-node), or follow the instructions in
the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/).

Open the MetaMask extension on your browser and log in to your
MetaMask account if you are not already. Then click the top right circle and go
to `Settings` > `Networks` > `Add Network` and fill the form as shown below.

import ProjectValue from '@site/src/components/ProjectValue';
import Highlighter from '@site/src/components/Highlighter';

![metamask networks settings](/img/metamask_network_settings.png)

Here is the list of fields that you can use to paste on Metamask:

- **Network Name:** <Highlighter keyword="name" postText=" Local" />
- **New RPC URL:** <Highlighter keyword="rpc_url_local" />
- **Chain ID:** <Highlighter keyword="rpc_url_local" />
- **Currency Symbol (optional):** <Highlighter keyword="testnet_ticker" />
- **Block Explorer URL (optional):** `n/a`

In case you can't open up the MetaMask extension or are blocked in some way, alternatively, you can go on ChainList and switch to a different RPC address. To do this:
- go on https://chainlist.org/chain/9001
- look for another available RPC server
- Connect your wallet
- Click Approve

Now you should be connected to a server and be able to properly use MetaMask.

## Importing Accounts

If you own the private key to an account, you can import it to Metamask to use
the account on Evmos. Go to `My Accounts` (top right circle) and select `Import
Account`. You should see an image like the following one:

![metamask manual import account page](/img/metamask_import.png)

:::tip
If it takes some time to load the balance of the account, change the
network to `Main Ethereum Network` (or any other than `Localhost 8545` or
<Highlighter keyword="name" />) and then switch back to <Highlighter
keyword="name" />.

## Download Account State

To see your Metamask logs, click the top right circle and go to `Settings` >
`Advanced` > `State Logs`. If you search through the JSON file for the account
address you'll find the transaction history.

## Reset Account

If you used your Metamask account for a legacy testnet/mainnet upgrade, you will
need to reset your account in order to use it with the new network. This will
clear your account's transaction history, but it won't change the balances in
your accounts or require you to re-enter your Secret Recovery Phrase.

:::warning
Make sure you download your [account state](#download-account-state)
to persist public account addresses and transactions before clearing your wallet
accounts.
:::

Go to `Settings` > `Advanced`  and click the `Reset Account` button as shown
below:
