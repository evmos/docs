# Overview

## Why develop dApps on Evmos?

The Evmos Core Development Team is on a mission to provide the foundational tools necessary for building the cross-chain applications of the future, freeing developers from the confines of todayâ€™s siloed blockchains.

Evmos focuses on cross-chain **innovation** so that developers can build entirely new dApp experiences for their users. Deploying smart contracts on Evmos is **easy**, as the Evmos blockchain is fully compatible with Ethereum and its rich ecosystem of robust tooling, wallets, explorers, a surplus of assets, and intelligent end-users. At the same time, Evmos allows developers to build **scalable** EVM dApp chains with the upcoming Evmos SDK and it hosts one of the most active community governance that seeks **fairness** across all key actors (users, builders, and validators).

Evmos does this by leveraging the interoperability of the Cosmos Ecosystem and the market-dominating support for EVM development. This allows dApp developers to use Ethereum smart contracts to implement the business logic on-chain while having access to Cosmos chain functionalities, such as exchanging value with the rest of the Cosmos Ecosystem through the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).


## How to build a dApp

Following this documentation and our academy you can learn how to build a dApp on Evmos and become part of the rich ecosystem of EVM builders on Cosmos. Whether you are building new use cases on Evmos or porting an existing dApp from another chain, you can learn how to [build and deploy smart contracts](./build-a-dApp/build-smart-contracts/build-smart-contracts.md) and what [tools](./tools/index.md) are available to build a web3 [frontend](./build-a-dApp/build-a-frontend/wallet-integration.md) and [backend](./build-a-dApp/create-centralized-backend.md) to create a seamless web3 experience for users of your dApp on Evmos.

Once tested on [Testnet](../develop/testnet/api.md) and deployed on [Mainnet](../develop/mainnet/index.md), you can start [earning an income](../develop/mainnet/revenue.md) on transaction fees from interacting with your dApp or [register your tokens](../develop/mainnet/token-registration.md) for cross-chain use.


## Contributors

You can also contribute to the Evmos ecosystem without building a dApp. Head over to [tools](./tools/index.md) to learn how to contribute as a full-stack developer by building new dev tools or [protocol](../protocol) to help out building the core protocol.
