# EVM Extensions

## Overview

EVM Extensions are precompiled contracts that are built into the Ethereum
Virtual Machine (EVM).
Each offers specific functionality, that can be used by other smart contracts.
Generally, they are used to perform operations that are either not possible
or would be too expensive to perform with a regular smart contract
implementation, such as hashing, elliptic curve cryptography, and modular exponentiation.

By adding custom EVM extensions to Ethereum's basic feature set,
Evmos allows developers to use previously unavailable functionality in smart contracts, like staking and governance operations.
This will allow more complex smart contracts to be built on Evmos and further improves the interoperability between Cosmos and Ethereum.
It also is a key feature to achieve Evmos' vision of being the definitive dApp
chain, where any dApp can be deployed once and users are able to interact with
a wide range of different blockchains natively.

To enable the described funtionalities, Evmos introduces socalled *stateful* precompiled smart contracts,
which have the capability to perform a state transition,
as opposed to those offered by the standard Go-Ethereum implementation,
that can only read state information.
This is necessary, because an operation like e.g. staking tokens
will ultimately change the chain state.

## Available Extensions

The following extensions are available in Evmos' implementation of the EVM:
