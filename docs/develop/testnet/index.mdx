# Testnet

import { chainConfig, handler } from '@site/src/utils/ChainConfig';

The Evmos Testnet is a decentralized blockchain network
that runs parallel to the Mainnet.
It allows developers to test and deploy their decentralized applications (dApps)
in a safe and secure environment without the risk of losing real funds.
It is run by Validators using the same software as on the Evmos Mainnet,
which means it is built using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
and supports the Ethereum toolchain.
This makes it compatible with a vast ecosystem
of existing Ethereum-based applications and tools.

Using the Evmos Testnet provides several benefits for dApp developers.
Firstly, it enables them to test and refine their smart contracts
and dApps in a sandbox environment without the risk of making costly mistakes.
Developers can experiment with different use cases and scenarios,
simulate various network conditions,
and stress test their applications to ensure they are scalable and resilient.
Secondly, the Evmos Testnet provides a community-driven
and collaborative platform for developers to share knowledge, best practices, and code.
This can help developers to speed up their development process
and tap into a wealth of resources and expertise.

Find out below how to connect to Testnet
and request testnet tokens from the Faucet to start developing.
Note, that tokens on Testnet don’t have actual value,
so that you don’t need to worry about loosing funds.

## Connect to Testnet

## Faucet

import ProjectValue from '@site/src/components/ProjectValue';
import Highlighter from '@site/src/components/Highlighter';

The Evmos Testnet [Faucet](https://faucet.evmos.dev/) distributes small amounts
of <ProjectValue keyword="testnet_ticker" /> to anyone who can provide a valid
testnet address. Users can request funds from the faucet either by using the
Keplr or Metamask.

Follow the [Metamask](./../../use/connect-your-wallet/metamask), [Keplr](./../../use/connect-your-wallet/keplr)
or [Keyring](./../../protocol/concepts/keyring) guides for more info on how to setup your wallet account.

After receiving funds from the faucet, view your account balance either by
clicking on the Wallet extension or by using the [Testnet
Explorer](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet).
