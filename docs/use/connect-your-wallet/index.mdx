# Wallet Overview

Evmos network supports both Cosmos and ERC-20 coins. There are several wallets that work with the network. Some of these wallets support Ledger connectivity. Consult the table below for more information. We recommend Metamask and Keplr wallets. These two wallets also work with the Ledger. For more information about Ledger, proceed to [here](./ledger).
