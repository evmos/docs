# Getting started

## What is Evmos?

Evmos is the blockchain network, that lets you use a new generation of applications, build by developers permissionlessly across the world.

We believe that you shouldn't be constrained to interacting only with applications on one blockchain. This creates a bad user experience forcing you to reconnect to new networks and transferring currencies between different blockchains. Instead you should be able to seamlessly use applications, regardless of where they are build.

That's why at Evmos we enable developers to create applications "cross-chain". These are build once and are accessible from across multiple chains. As a result, you can seamlessly interact with applications on Evmos, without having to know what underlying blockchain they are built on.

This is special because we make scalable blockchain applications accessable to the next million users, builders, and communities.

## What kind of applications? What can you do on Evmos?

Once connected to the Evmos network, you can send money peer-to-peer without the need of a banks or payment services or interact with decentralized applications (dApps) cross-chain.

Every day, developers are contributing to a growing ecosystem of new dApps on Emvos..
* dApps
* create communities

Alongside the applications build by the developer community, the Evmos Core Development Team also maintians their own dApps, e.g. for viewing cross-chain assets or staking. To get started, read about how to connect your wallet, transfer tokens and interact with dApps.

# What is Evmos

Evmos is a scalable, high-throughput Proof-of-Stake blockchain that is fully compatible and
interoperable with Ethereum. It's built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/) which runs on top of [Tendermint Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) consensus engine.

Evmos allows for running vanilla Ethereum as a [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/)
application-specific blockchain. This allows developers to have all the desired features of
Ethereum, while at the same time, benefit from Tendermint’s PoS implementation. Also, because it is
built on top of the Cosmos SDK, it will be able to exchange value with the rest of the Cosmos
Ecosystem through the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).

### Features

Here’s a glance at some of the key features of Evmos:

* Web3 and EVM compatibility
* High throughput via [Tendermint Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint)
* Horizontal scalability via [IBC](https://cosmos.network/ibc)
* Fast transaction finality

Evmos enables these key features by:

* Implementing Tendermint Core's Application Blockchain Interface ([ABCI](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/spec/abci/)) to manage the blockchain
* Leveraging [modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/building-modules/intro.html) and other mechanisms implemented by the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/).
* Utilizing [`geth`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) as a library to promote code reuse and improve maintainability.
* Exposing a fully compatible Web3 [JSON-RPC](../../develop/build-a-dApp/clients/ethereum-JSON-RPC/JSON-RPC) layer for interacting with existing Ethereum clients and tooling ([Metamask](../connect-your-wallet/metamask), [Remix](academy.evmos.org), [Truffle](academy.evmos.org), etc).

The sum of these features allows developers to leverage existing Ethereum ecosystem tooling and
software to seamlessly deploy smart contracts which interact with the rest of the Cosmos
[ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem)!

## Introduction

Evmos is a Cosmos-based chain with full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support. Because of this [architecture](./../protocol), tokens and assets in the network may come from different independent sources.

## The EVMOS Token

The denomination used for staking, governance and gas consumption on the EVM is the EVMOS. The EVMOS provides the utility of: securing the Proof-of-Stake chain, token used for governance proposals, distribution of fees to validator and users, and as a mean of gas for running smart contracts on the EVM.

Evmos uses [Atto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atto-) EVMOS as the base denomination to maintain parity with Ethereum.

1 evmos = 10<sup>18</sup> aevmos

This matches Ethereum denomination of:

1 ETH = 10<sup>18</sup> wei

## Cosmos Coins

Accounts can own Cosmos coins in their balance, which are used for operations with other Cosmos and transactions. Examples of these are using the coins for staking, IBC transfers, governance deposits and EVM.

## EVM Tokens

Evmos is compatible with ERC20 tokens and other non-fungible token standards (EIP721, EIP1155)
that are natively supported by the EVM.
