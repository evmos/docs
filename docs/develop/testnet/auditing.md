# Security Audits

Security audit is a comprehensive evaluation of the security and stability of a smart contract or decentralized
application (dApp) built on the EVM chains. The purpose of this audit is to identify potential vulnerabilities and
weaknesses in the code that could compromise the integrity of the dApp, as well as to ensure that the code is robust and
 free of bugs that could lead to unintended consequences.

A security audit typically involves a thorough examination of the smart contract code and its architecture, as well as
 any dependencies and external libraries that are used. The audit team will also consider the potential threat models
  and attack scenarios that the dApp may face, and test the code to ensure that it can withstand these attacks.

Some common areas of focus in a security audit include:

- Input validation: checking that inputs to the smart contract are correctly formatted and validated
- Performance: verifying that the code is scalable and efficient, and will not cause the Evmos network to become congested
- Error handling: verifying that the code handles errors and exceptions in a secure and robust manner
- Re-entrancy guard: checking for vulnerabilities that allow malicious actors to repeatedly call the smart contract
- Access control: ensuring that the smart contract has appropriate permissions and restrictions in place to control
access to its methods and data

Security audits are performed by experienced security experts who are familiar with the Ethereum platformm, ecosystem,
and the Solidity programming language. These experts use a variety of tools and techniques to evaluate the code, and
provide a detailed report of their findings and recommendations.

It is important to note that security audits are not a guarantee that a dApp is 100% secure, as new vulnerabilities may
be discovered over time. However, a security audit can significantly reduce the risk of security incidents and provide a
higher degree of confidence in the stability and security of a dApp. Displaying the audit report on dApp can further
increase transparency and trust building.
