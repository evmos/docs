# Indexers

A graph indexer allows developers to efficiently query the network for information about transactions, addresses, and other data stored on the blockchain. This enables developers to build decentralized applications that can access and display the data in a meaningful way, without having to search through the entire blockchain for each query.

For example, a graph indexer could be used to search for all transactions associated with a particular address or to find all transactions that include a specific token. This type of indexing can greatly improve the speed and efficiency of decentralized applications and make it easier for users to access and analyze the data stored on the blockchain.
