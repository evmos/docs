# Testnet

import { chainConfig, handler } from '@site/src/utils/ChainConfig';

The Evmos Testnet is a decentralized blockchain network
that runs parallel to the Mainnet.
It allows developers to test and deploy their decentralized applications (dApps)
in a safe and secure environment without the risk of losing real funds.
It is run by Validators using the same software as on the Evmos Mainnet,
which means it is built using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
and supports the Ethereum toolchain.
This makes it compatible with a vast ecosystem
of existing Ethereum-based applications and tools.

Using the Evmos Testnet provides several benefits for dApp developers.
Firstly, it enables them to test and refine their smart contracts
and dApps in a sandbox environment without the risk of making costly mistakes.
Developers can experiment with different use cases and scenarios,
simulate various network conditions,
and stress test their applications to ensure they are scalable and resilient.
Secondly, the Evmos Testnet provides a community-driven
and collaborative platform for developers to share knowledge, best practices, and code.
This can help developers to speed up their development process
and tap into a wealth of resources and expertise.

Note, that tokens on Testnet don’t have actual value,
so that you don’t need to worry about loosing funds.

## Security Audits

Security audit is a comprehensive evaluation of the security and stability of a smart contract or decentralized
application (dApp) built on the EVM chains. The purpose of this audit is to identify potential vulnerabilities and
weaknesses in the code that could compromise the integrity of the dApp, as well as to ensure that the code is robust and
 free of bugs that could lead to unintended consequences.

A security audit typically involves a thorough examination of the smart contract code and its architecture, as well as
 any dependencies and external libraries that are used. The audit team will also consider the potential threat models
  and attack scenarios that the dApp may face, and test the code to ensure that it can withstand these attacks.

Some common areas of focus in a security audit include:

- Input validation: checking that inputs to the smart contract are correctly formatted and validated
- Performance: verifying that the code is scalable and efficient, and will not cause the Evmos network to become congested
- Error handling: verifying that the code handles errors and exceptions in a secure and robust manner
- Re-entrancy guard: checking for vulnerabilities that allow malicious actors to repeatedly call the smart contract
- Access control: ensuring that the smart contract has appropriate permissions and restrictions in place to control
access to its methods and data

Security audits are performed by experienced security experts who are familiar with the Ethereum platformm, ecosystem,
and the Solidity programming language. These experts use a variety of tools and techniques to evaluate the code, and
provide a detailed report of their findings and recommendations.

It is important to note that security audits are not a guarantee that a dApp is 100% secure, as new vulnerabilities may
be discovered over time. However, a security audit can significantly reduce the risk of security incidents and provide a
higher degree of confidence in the stability and security of a dApp. Displaying the audit report on dApp can further
increase transparency and trust building.
