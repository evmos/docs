# Oracles

Oracles are a crucial component of the decentralized web, enabling smart contracts to access off-chain data and interact with the real world. These oracles serve as a bridge between the decentralized, trustless environment of blockchain and the centralized, traditional internet.

An oracle is a piece of software that retrieves data from external sources and feeds it into smart contracts on the blockchain. This enables smart contracts to respond to real-world events, trigger automated actions, and execute their intended functions.

Evmos partners with several oracles providers to help provide value feed services and more.

Our partners include:
