# Build A Frontend

Decentralized applications (dApps) are a new way of building applications for the internet, which makes use of
blockchain technology and smart contracts. Unlike traditional applications, dApps don't rely on a centralized server
or backend for their functioning. Instead, their backend is hosted on a b


- They are decentralized and operate on a peer-to-peer network, such as a blockchain, using smart contracts.
- The application's data and records must be stored on a public blockchain.
- They are open-source and operate on their own without any single entity controlling them.
- They use a cryptographic token to help keep their network secure.

 To develop dApps, it is essential to know how to interact with blockchain programmatically and understand the software
  development aspect of it. Some applications build to leverage the Evmos Network involves
