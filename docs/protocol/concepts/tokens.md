# Tokens

Evmos uses [Atto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atto-) EVMOS as the base denomination to maintain parity with Ethereum.

1 evmos = 10<sup>18</sup> aevmos

This matches Ethereum denomination of:

1 ETH = 10<sup>18</sup> wei


### Cosmos Coins

Accounts can own Cosmos coins in their balance, which are used for operations with other Cosmos and transactions. Examples of these are using the coins for staking, IBC transfers, governance deposits and EVM.

### EVM Tokens

Evmos is compatible with ERC20 tokens and other non-fungible token standards (EIP721, EIP1155)
that are natively supported by the EVM.
