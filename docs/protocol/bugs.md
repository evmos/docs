# Bugs

When creating a Layer 1 (L1) protocol chain, taking security seriously is of utmost importance. L1 protocols are the
backbone of the blockchain ecosystem, and any security vulnerabilities within the L1 can lead to a range of potential
consequences, from financial loss to reputation damage to even the collapse of the entire network. As such, security
is an essential aspect of developing any L1 protocol chain, and security must be considered at every step of the
development process. Check out our [Audits](./security/audits).

Despite our best efforts, security issues may still arise in our L1 protocol chain. In such cases, we encourage our users
to report any vulnerabilities or bugs they may find. For sensitive bugs, we ask that users submit the issue to
[Evmos Security](mailto:security@evmos.org), which is a third-party security platform that helps us identify, triage,
and resolve security issues in a confidential and secure manner. For non-sensitive bugs, we encourage users to file an
open ticket on our [Evmos Github Repo](https://github.com/evmos/evmos) so that our team can address the issue as quickly
as possible.
