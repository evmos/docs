# Architecture

Learn how Evmos's architecture leverages the Cosmos SDK Proof-of-Stake functionality, EVM compatibility and fast-finality
 from Tendermint Core's BFT consensus.

## Cosmos SDK

Evmos enables the full composability and modularity of the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/).

## Tendermint Core & the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI)

Tendermint consists of two chief technical components: a blockchain consensus
engine and a generic application interface. The consensus engine, called
[Tendermint Core](https://docs.tendermint.com/), ensures that the same transactions are recorded on every machine
in the same order. The application interface, called the [Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI)](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/spec/abci/),
 enables the transactions to be processed in any programming
language.

Tendermint has evolved to be a general purpose blockchain consensus engine that
can host arbitrary application states. Since Tendermint can replicate arbitrary
applications, it can be used as a plug-and-play replacement for the consensus
engines of other blockchains. Evmos is such an example of an ABCI application
replacing Ethereum's PoW via Tendermint's consensus engine.

Another example of a cryptocurrency application built on Tendermint is the Cosmos
network. Tendermint is able to decompose the blockchain design by offering a very
simple API (ie. the ABCI) between the application process and consensus process.

## EVM module

Evmos enables EVM compatibility by implementing various components that together support all the EVM state transitions 
while ensuring the same developer experience as Ethereum:

- Ethereum transaction format as a Cosmos SDK `Tx` and `Msg` interface
- Ethereum's `secp256k1` curve for the Cosmos Keyring
- `StateDB` interface for state updates and queries
- JSON-RPC client for interacting with the EVM



<!-- Moved from other pages during the refactor


Evmos is a Cosmos-based chain with full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support. Because of this architecture, tokens and assets in the network may come from different independent sources.

Evmos is a scalable, high-throughput Proof-of-Stake blockchain that is fully compatible and
interoperable with Ethereum. It's built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/) which runs on top of [Tendermint Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) consensus engine.

Hereâ€™s a glance at some of the key features of Evmos:

* Web3 and EVM compatibility
* High throughput via [Tendermint Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint)
* Horizontal scalability via [IBC](https://cosmos.network/ibc)
* Fast transaction finality

Evmos enables these key features by:

* Implementing Tendermint Core's Application Blockchain Interface ([ABCI](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/spec/abci/)) to manage the blockchain
* Leveraging [modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/building-modules/intro.html) and other mechanisms implemented by the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/).
* Utilizing [`geth`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) as a library to promote code reuse and improve maintainability.
* Exposing a fully compatible Web3 [JSON-RPC](./apis/ethereum-JSON-RPC/JSON-RPC) layer for interacting with existing Ethereum clients and tooling Metamask, Remix, Truffle, etc).


The sum of these features allows developers to leverage existing Ethereum ecosystem tooling and
software to seamlessly deploy smart contracts which interact with the rest of the Cosmos
[ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem)!

## The EVMOS Token

The denomination used for staking, governance and gas consumption on the EVM is the EVMOS. The EVMOS provides the utility of: securing the Proof-of-Stake chain, token used for governance proposals, distribution of fees to validator and users, and as a mean of gas for running smart contracts on the EVM.

Evmos uses [Atto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atto-) EVMOS as the base denomination to maintain parity with Ethereum.

1 evmos = 10<sup>18</sup> aevmos

This matches Ethereum denomination of:

1 ETH = 10<sup>18</sup> wei

## Cosmos Coins

Accounts can own Cosmos coins in their balance, which are used for operations with other Cosmos and transactions. Examples of these are using the coins for staking, IBC transfers, governance deposits and EVM.

## EVM Tokens

Evmos is compatible with ERC20 tokens and other non-fungible token standards (EIP721, EIP1155)
that are natively supported by the EVM.
