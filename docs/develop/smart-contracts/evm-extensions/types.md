# Types

To honor development best practices,
the team defined a `Types.sol` file that keeps types shared along the precompiled contracts.

- `Types.sol`

```solidity
/// @dev Dec represents a fixed point decimal value. The value is stored as an integer, and the
/// precision is stored as a uint8. The value is multiplied by 10^precision to get the actual value.
struct Dec {
    uint256 value;
    uint8 precision;
}

/// @dev Coin is a struct that represents a token with a denomination and an amount.
struct Coin {
    string denom;
    uint256 amount;
}

/// @dev DecCoin is a struct that represents a token with a denomination, an amount and a precision.
struct DecCoin {
    string denom;
    uint256 amount;
    uint8 precision;
}

/// @dev PageResponse is a struct that represents a page response.
struct PageResponse {
    bytes nextKey;
    uint64 total;
}
```
