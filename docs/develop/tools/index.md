# Other Tools

Tools play a crucial role in blockchain development as they help streamline the development process and make it easier
for developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps). Decentralized applications (dApps) are built on
blockchain technology, which requires specific tools and frameworks for development. Some of the most commonly used tools
 in dApp development include:

- [Tools and Plugins](./tools-plugins.md): There are many tools and plugins to aid in the development of dApps. These include
smart contract languages and frameworks, development environments, wallet and identity management plugins, and analytics
and monitoring tools.
- [Client Integration](./client-integrations.md): EvmosJS and PyEvmos are two examples of client integration toolings to
help developers interact with our core protocol features by providing interfaces, types, signing abstractions, and more.
- [Contract Verifications](./contract-verifications.md): This is an important process in blockchain development that
involves validating the authenticity and accuracy of smart contract code before deploying it to the blockchain. Contract
verification serves to increase transparency, improves contract accuracy, prevents fraud and malicious activities,
and increases adoption.
