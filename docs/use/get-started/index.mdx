# Introduction to Evmos

Evmos is a flagship implementation that provides a scalable, high-throughput Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain and is fully compatible and
interoperable with Ethereum. It's built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/) which runs on top of [Tendermint Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) consensus engine.

Evmos allows for running vanilla Ethereum as a [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/)
application-specific blockchain. This allows developers to have all the desired features of
Ethereum, while at the same time, benefit from Tendermint’s PoS implementation. Also, because it is
built on top of the Cosmos SDK, it will be able to exchange value with the rest of the Cosmos
Ecosystem through the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).

### Features

Here’s a glance at some of the key features of Evmos:

* Web3 and EVM compatibility
* High throughput via [Tendermint Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint)
* Horizontal scalability via [IBC](https://cosmos.network/ibc)
* Fast transaction finality

Evmos enables these key features by:

* Implementing Tendermint Core's Application Blockchain Interface ([ABCI](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/spec/abci/)) to manage the blockchain
* Leveraging [modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/building-modules/intro.html) and other mechanisms implemented by the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/).
* Utilizing [`geth`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) as a library to promote code reuse and improve maintainability.
* Exposing a fully compatible Web3 [JSON-RPC](../../develop/build-a-dApp/clients/ethereum-JSON-RPC/JSON-RPC) layer for interacting with existing Ethereum clients and tooling ([Metamask](../wallet/metamask), [Remix](academy.evmos.org), [Truffle](academy.evmos.org), etc).

The sum of these features allows developers to leverage existing Ethereum ecosystem tooling and
software to seamlessly deploy smart contracts which interact with the rest of the Cosmos
[ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem)!

## Introduction

Evmos is a Cosmos-based chain with full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support. Because of this [architecture](./../protocol), tokens and assets in the network may come from different independent sources.
