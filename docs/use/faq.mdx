# Frequently Asked Questions

## Wallets

<details>

<summary>Which wallet would you recommend for Evmos?</summary>

There are many wallets to select from but the top wallets with the widest support is [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) and [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/). Evmos is an EVM chain built on top of the Cosmos SDK and Metamask does not support non EVM-specific assets while Keplr wallet does. Keplr wallet will soon support ERC-20.

<summary>For certain wallets, I see both bech32 and hex while others only show hex formatted addresses, which should I use?</summary>

The Evmos network supports both formats: bech32 and hex. Other EVM peers and its ecosystem uses hex encoding while Cosmos-native uses bech32 formatted addresses. Keplr is unique and the EVM-compatible chains shows both formats. If you are sending tokens (via [IBC](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/relayers)), you will use bech32 formatted addresses unless the receiving chain support EVM (i.e. Ethermint-based chains). You can further details [here](./../protocol/concepts/accounts).
