# IBC Channels

IBC channels are a key component of the Inter-blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol used in the Cosmos ecosystem. 
IBC channels enable communication between different Cosmos chains, allowing the transfer of tokens and data between 
them. Each IBC channel has a unique identifier known as the channel ID, which is used to specify the source and 
destination of a transfer. The channel ID can change depending on which relayers are active, so it's important to
 double-check the channel IDs before making a transfer.
