# Tools

Tools play a crucial role in blockchain development as they help streamline the development process and make it easier
for developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps). Decentralized applications (dApps) are built on
blockchain technology, which requires specific tools and frameworks for development. Some of the most commonly used tools
 in dApp development include:

- [Oracles](./oracles.md): an oracle is a third-party service that provides external information or data to the blockchain
network upon which the dApp operates.
- [Explorers](./explorers.md): Block explorers are online tools that allow users to browse and search a blockchain's
transaction history, view current network statistics, and explore individual blocks, transactions, and addresses. They
provide a user-friendly way to interact with a blockchain, making it easy to track transactions, monitor network
activity, and gain insights into the inner workings of the blockchain.
- [Indexers](./indexers.md): Indexers are services that provide developers with fast and efficient access to blockchain data.
They allow developers to query a blockchain's transaction history, account balances, smart contracts, and other data
in a more flexible and user-friendly way compared to using raw blockchain data.
- [Tools and Plugins](./tools-plugins.md): There are many tools and plugins to aid in the development of dApps. These include
smart contract languages and frameworks, development environments, wallet and identity management plugins, and analytics
and monitoring tools.
- [Client Integration](./client-integrations.md): EvmosJS and PyEvmos are two examples of client integration toolings to
help developers interact with our core protocol features by providing interfaces, types, signing abstractions, and more.
- [Contract Verifications](./contract-verifications.md): This is an important process in blockchain development that
involves validating the authenticity and accuracy of smart contract code before deploying it to the blockchain. Contract
verification serves to increase transparency, improves contract accuracy, prevents fraud and malicious activities,
and increases adoption.
