# Frequently Asked Questions

## Wallets

<details>

<summary><b>Which wallet would you recommend for Evmos?</b></summary>

There are many wallets to select from but the top wallets with the widest support are [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
and [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/). Evmos is an EVM chain built on top of the Cosmos SDK and Metamask does not support
non EVM-specific assets while Keplr wallet does. Keplr wallet will soon support ERC-20.

<summary><b>Can I use my Ledger device?</b></summary>

Absolutely! Take a look at the [Ledger](./connect-your-wallet/keplr) for more information. Metamask,
Keplr, and WalletConnect all work with Ledger. Ledger setup will be required before engaging with the dApps and products on Evmos.

<details>

<summary><b>For certain wallets, I see both bech32 and hex while others only show hex formatted addresses, which should
 I use?</b></summary>

The Evmos network supports both formats: bech32 and hex. Other EVM peers and its ecosystem uses hex encoding while
Cosmos-native uses bech32 formatted addresses. Keplr is unique and the EVM-compatible chains shows both formats. If you
are sending tokens (via [IBC](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/relayers)), you will use bech32 formatted addresses unless
the receiving chain support EVM (i.e. Ethermint-based chains). You can further details [here](./../protocol/concepts/accounts).
