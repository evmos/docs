# Distribution

## Solidity Interface & ABI

`Distribution.sol` is an interface through which Solidity contracts can interact with Cosmos SDK distribution.
This is convenient for developers as they donâ€™t need to know the implementation details behind
the `x/distribution` module in the Cosmos SDK. Instead,
they can interact with staking functions using the Ethereum interface they are familiar with.

### Interface `Distribution.sol`

```solidity

## Events

Each of the transactions emits its corresponding event. These are:

- `SetWithdrawerAddress`

    ```solidity
    /// @dev SetWithdrawerAddress defines an Event emitted when a new withdrawer address is being set
    /// @param caller the caller of the transaction
    /// @param withdrawerAddress the newly set withdrawer address
    event SetWithdrawerAddress(

        string withdrawerAddress
    );
    ```

- `WithdrawDelegatorRewards`

    ```solidity
    /// @dev WithdrawDelegatorRewards defines an Event emitted when rewards from a delegation are withdrawn
    /// @param delegatorAddress the address of the delegator
    /// @param validatorAddress the address of the validator
    /// @param amount the amount being withdrawn from the delegation
    event WithdrawDelegatorRewards(
        address indexed delegatorAddress,
        string indexed validatorAddress,
        uint256 amount
    );
    ```

- `WithdrawValidatorCommission`

    ```solidity
    /// @dev WithdrawValidatorCommission defines an Event emitted when validator commissions are being withdrawn
    /// @param validatorAddress is the address of the validator
    /// @param commission is the total commission earned by the validator
    event WithdrawValidatorCommission(
        string indexed validatorAddress,
        uint256 commission
    );
    ```

## Interact with the Solidity Interface

Below are some examples of how to interact with this Solidity interface from your smart contracts.

Make sure to import the precompiled interface, e.g.:

```solidity
import "https://github.com/evmos/extensions/blob/main/precompiles/stateful/Distribution.sol";
```

### Grant approval for the desired messages

See below a function that grants approval to the smart contract to send all `x/distribution` module messages
on behalf of the sender account. You can tweak this function to approve only the desired messages.

```solidity
string[] private distributionMethods = [
    MSG_SET_WITHDRAWER_ADDRESS,
    MSG_WITHDRAW_DELEGATOR_REWARD,
    MSG_WITHDRAW_VALIDATOR_COMMISSION,
];

/// @dev Approves all distribution transactions.
/// @dev This creates a Cosmos Authorization Grant for the given methods.
/// @dev This emits an Approval event from the GenericAuthorization.sol.
function approveAllDistributionMethods() public {
    bool success = DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT.approve(
        msg.sender,
        distributionMethods
    );
    require(success, "Failed to approve distribution methods");
}
```

### Set withdraw address

The `changeWithdrawAddress` function allows a user to set a new withdraw address in the Cosmos `x/distribution` module.
For this transaction to be successful, make sure the user had already approved the `MSG_SET_WITHDRAWER_ADDRESS` message.

```solidity
function changeWithdrawAddress(
    string memory _withdrawAddr
) public returns (bool) {
    return
        distribution.DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT.setWithdrawAddress(
            msg.sender,
            _withdrawAddr
        );
}
```

### Withdraw staking rewards

The `withdrawStakingRewards` function allows a user to withdraw his/her rewards corresponding to a specified validator.
For this transaction to be successful, make sure the user had already approved the `MSG_WITHDRAW_DELEGATOR_REWARD` message.

```solidity
	function withdrawStakingRewards(
    string memory _valAddr
) public returns (types.Coin[] memory) {
    return
        distribution.DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT.withdrawDelegatorRewards(
            msg.sender,
            _valAddr
        );
}
```

### Withdraw validator commission

If the user is running a validator, he/she could withdraw the corresponding commission using a smart contract.
The user could use a function similar to `withdrawCommission`.
For this transaction to be successful,
make sure the user had already approved the `MSG_WITHDRAW_VALIDATOR_COMMISSION` message.

```solidity
function withdrawCommission(
    string memory _valAddr
) public returns (types.Coin[] memory) {
    return
        distribution.DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT.withdrawValidatorCommission(
            _valAddr
        );
}
```

### Queries

Similarly to transactions, smart contracts can use query methods. To use these methods,
there is no need for authorization, as these are read-only methods.
Examples of this are the `getDelegationRewards` and `getValidatorCommision`
functions that return the information for the specified validator address.

```solidity
getDelegationRewards(
    string memory _valAddr
) public view returns (types.DecCoin[] memory) {
    return
        distribution.DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT.delegationRewards(
            msg.sender,
            _valAddr
        );
}

function getValidatorCommission(
    string memory _valAddr
) public view returns (types.DecCoin[] memory) {
    return distribution.DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT.validatorCommission(_valAddr);
}
```
